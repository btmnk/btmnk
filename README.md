### Hello there
![](https://cloud.bitmonk.de/s/2ZBt2JPNZK58Kdr/preview)

I'm a (kindof) fullstack developer working with mainly React, Typescript and Node.js. I also try to always have one feet in all the stuff around a web application such as Github Actions, Jenkins, Kubernetes, Grafana, Prometheus..

While I'm working as a professional frontend developer I also enjoy building backend applications, bots or just plain simple scripts to ease my everyday work. Since I don't have many opportunities at work to fulfill my desire of learning more about what lies beyond the small crazy frontend domain I use my freetime to create projects with which I hopefully learn whatever I'm missing out on otherwise.


#### Bakatron Discord Bot
One of the projects I'm currently working on is a discord bot build with [Moleculer](https://moleculer.services/) and [Discord.js](https://discord.js.org/#/). Since I usually don't hesitate to go overboard with private projects I also build the application as a microservice system which is deployed with kubernetes on a small cluster. \
If you're interested in the bot you can checkout [Bakatrons official website](https://bakatron.app) or the [Bakatron support server](https://discord.gg/xjkqCJUqfe)

#### klarheit frontend toolkit
My newer project is @klarheit which I created as a result of working on Bakatron. Since I created a lot of UI components for the frontend application I thought it would make sense to maybe move them to a separate toolkit project where I can manage them and perhaps also use them in other future projects. Maybe some people get interested in using it as well. It's still in its early stages but there is already a webpack react boilerplate that can be installed with a CLI. \
