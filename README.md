## Hello there!

My name is Rico also known as "Blume" and I'm a fullstack developer working with React, Typescript and Node.js.

For me software development is a craftsmanship where elegance and aesthetic are just as important as efficiency and functionality. \
I always try to combine these aspects to create a product that people enjoy to use.

## Some of my projects

#### Kumo Discord Bot
One of the projects I'm currently working on is a discord bot build with [Moleculer](https://moleculer.services/) and [Discord.js](https://discord.js.org/#/). Since I usually don't hesitate to go overboard with private projects I also build the application as a microservice system which is deployed with kubernetes on a small cluster.

If you're interested in the bot you can checkout [Kumo's official website](https://kumo.gg) or the [Kumo support server](https://discord.gg/xjkqCJUqfe)

#### REX
REX is a utility library for React with components, hooks and functions that don't fit into existing component libraries and solve very specific ui problems.

Check out the [documentation](https://etecture.github.io/rex/) or the [source code](https://github.com/etecture/rex)

## Projects that I recommend

- [Mantine](https://mantine.dev/) - I dare to say it's the best ui library currently available in open source
- [Drizzle ORM](https://orm.drizzle.team/) - Makes working with your database a lot easier and still provides a way to make your queries fast where it's necessary
- [Biome](https://biomejs.dev/) - The shining star among formatters and linters currently
- [Bun](https://bun.sh/) - Everything I **can** run with bun I **will** run with bun
- [tRPC](https://trpc.io/) - Whenever I'm not already using a framework like next.js where I can use server actions I use tRPC to handle data transfer.
