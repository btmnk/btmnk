## Hello there!

My name is Rico also known as "Blume" and I'm a fullstack developer working with React, Typescript and Node.js.

While I'm working as a professional frontend developer I also enjoy building backend applications, bots or just plain simple scripts to ease my everyday work. Since I don't have many opportunities at work to fulfill my desire of learning more about what lies beyond the small crazy frontend domain I use my freetime to create projects with which I hopefully learn whatever I'm missing out on otherwise.

## Some of my projects

#### Kumo Discord Bot
One of the projects I'm currently working on is a discord bot build with [Moleculer](https://moleculer.services/) and [Discord.js](https://discord.js.org/#/). Since I usually don't hesitate to go overboard with private projects I also build the application as a microservice system which is deployed with kubernetes on a small cluster.

If you're interested in the bot you can checkout [Kumo's official website](https://kumo.gg) or the [Kumo support server](https://discord.gg/xjkqCJUqfe)

#### REX
REX is a utility library for React with components, hooks and functions that don't fit into existing component libraries and solve very specific ui problems.

Check out the [documentation](https://etecture.github.io/rex/) or the [source code](https://github.com/etecture/rex)
